Comparing Life Expectancies of Men and Women in the United States
Riley Newton, Shriya Gawande, and Doreen Igieobo.
Our project was to compare the life expectancies of men and women across all of the states. We got our data from the CDC's National Vital Statistics Report. The data is from 2021 because that is the most recent data set. We used R to clean the data and run a variety of tests including a T-test and a linear regression test. We found that women on average live longer than men.
